## Constitutional Compliance Review

### Core Principles Verification
- [ ] **JavaScript-First Implementation**
  - [ ] Vanilla JavaScript used as primary method
  - [ ] jQuery used only as fallback when available
  - [ ] No dependency on external libraries beyond WordPress core

- [ ] **DataLayer Standardization**
  - [ ] ALL dataLayer fields use snake_case naming (not camelCase)
  - [ ] Required fields present: `cuft_tracked: true`, `cuft_source: "framework_name"`
  - [ ] Event names follow specification: `form_submit`, `generate_lead`
  - [ ] Timestamp format is ISO 8601: `new Date().toISOString()`

- [ ] **Framework Compatibility**
  - [ ] Silent exit implemented for non-relevant frameworks
  - [ ] No console output for irrelevant forms
  - [ ] Framework detection happens before any processing
  - [ ] Multiple frameworks can coexist without interference

- [ ] **Event Firing Rules**
  - [ ] `form_submit` fires on every successful submission
  - [ ] `generate_lead` fires only when email + phone + click_id present
  - [ ] Events fire exactly once per submission (deduplication implemented)

- [ ] **Error Handling Philosophy**
  - [ ] Graceful degradation implemented
  - [ ] Fallback chains present for data retrieval
  - [ ] All external calls wrapped in try-catch blocks
  - [ ] Errors logged appropriately (debug mode only)
