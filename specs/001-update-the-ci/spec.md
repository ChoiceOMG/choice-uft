# Feature Specification: CI Release Preparation for WordPress Installation

**Feature Branch**: `001-update-the-ci`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update the CI to sufficiently prepare the relase for wordpress installation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clear: CI automation for WordPress release preparation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí CI pipeline, release preparation, WordPress installation ready packages
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities identified in core requirement
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: maintainer triggers release, CI creates WordPress-ready package
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via CI pipeline validation
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Release artifacts, version metadata, installation packages
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and unambiguous
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a WordPress plugin maintainer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically prepare release packages ready for WordPress installation, so that users can install the plugin directly without manual packaging steps or missing files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a maintainer pushes a version tag, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** it creates a properly structured WordPress plugin zip file with correct naming
2. **Given** the CI completes successfully, **When** a user downloads the release asset, **Then** they receive a zip file that extracts to the correct WordPress plugin directory structure
3. **Given** the release zip is uploaded to WordPress, **When** WordPress extracts the plugin, **Then** all required files are present and the plugin activates successfully
4. **Given** WordPress auto-updater checks for updates, **When** querying the GitHub release, **Then** it detects the new version correctly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when version numbers are inconsistent between files?
- How does the system handle missing critical plugin files during packaging?
- What occurs if the zip file structure doesn't match WordPress expectations?
- How are development files prevented from being included in production releases?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: CI pipeline MUST automatically trigger when version tags are created or releases are published
- **FR-002**: CI pipeline MUST validate version consistency across all plugin files before packaging
- **FR-003**: CI pipeline MUST create a zip file named exactly "choice-uft.zip" (without version numbers) for proper WordPress directory extraction
- **FR-004**: CI pipeline MUST exclude development files (.git, .github, node_modules, .env, etc.) from the release package
- **FR-005**: CI pipeline MUST include all production-required files (PHP files, assets, documentation, etc.) in the package
- **FR-006**: CI pipeline MUST attach the created zip file as a release asset to the GitHub release
- **FR-007**: CI pipeline MUST verify the zip file structure matches WordPress plugin directory expectations
- **FR-008**: CI pipeline MUST update version numbers in plugin header and constants before packaging
- **FR-009**: CI pipeline MUST validate that the package can be successfully extracted and contains all critical files
- **FR-010**: CI pipeline MUST fail if any packaging step encounters errors, preventing incomplete releases

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Release Artifact**: WordPress-compatible zip file containing the complete plugin package
- **Version Metadata**: Version numbers stored in plugin headers, constants, and package files
- **Package Structure**: Directory layout and file organization required for WordPress plugin installation
- **Build Configuration**: CI pipeline settings defining packaging rules, file inclusions/exclusions, and validation steps
