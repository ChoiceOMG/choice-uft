# Feature Specification: Testing Dashboard Form Builder

**Feature Branch**: `003-testing-dashboard-form`
**Created**: 2025-01-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "testing-dashboard-form-builder, building on the testing dashboard, the test form builder will allow the generation of actual form instances within their respective frameworks based on what is installed. It will then use an iframe to show the test forms in an I frame and populate the fields with the test data. This expands on simulating form submissions by creating a real form to test with."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-10
- Q: When test forms are generated for testing purposes, how long should they exist in the system? ‚Üí A: Manual cleanup only - Forms persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted by the administrator
- Q: How much control should users have over the test data used to populate form fields? ‚Üí A: Use same sample data from testing dashboard
- Q: Who should be able to view and interact with the generated test forms? ‚Üí A: Admin-only - Only WordPress administrators can view and submit test forms
- Q: What types of form fields should the test form builder support? ‚Üí A: Basic fields only - Text, email, phone, textarea (sufficient for tracking validation)
- Q: When a test form is submitted through the iframe, where should the submission data go? ‚Üí A: Test endpoint - Submit to a dedicated test endpoint that logs but doesn't process

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site administrator testing the Universal Form Tracker plugin, I want to generate real test forms from any installed form framework (Elementor, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, etc.) directly within the testing dashboard. The system should create an actual working form instance, display it in an embedded iframe within the dashboard, and allow me to populate the form fields with predefined test data to verify that form tracking is working correctly across all supported frameworks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the testing dashboard is open and Elementor Pro is installed, **When** I select "Generate Elementor Form" and provide test configuration, **Then** a real Elementor form instance is created and displayed in an iframe within the dashboard
2. **Given** a test form is displayed in the iframe, **When** I click "Populate Test Data", **Then** all form fields are automatically filled with the configured test values
3. **Given** a populated test form in the iframe, **When** I submit the form, **Then** the tracking events are captured and displayed in the dashboard's event monitor
4. **Given** multiple form frameworks are installed, **When** I access the form builder, **Then** I can select which framework to generate a test form for
5. **Given** a test form has been generated, **When** I click "Delete Test Form", **Then** the form instance is removed from the system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no form frameworks are installed?
- How does system handle when a framework is installed but not activated?
- What happens if iframe fails to load the generated form?
- How does system handle form frameworks with required premium features not available?
- What happens when test data doesn't match the form field types?
- How does system clean up orphaned test forms if the process is interrupted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect all installed and active form framework plugins
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow selection of which framework to generate a test form for
- **FR-003**: System MUST create actual form instances within the selected framework that persist indefinitely until manually deleted
- **FR-004**: System MUST display generated forms within an iframe embedded in the testing dashboard
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide predefined test data sets for basic form field types (text, email, phone, textarea)
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically populate form fields with test data when requested
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture and display form submission events from the iframe, routing submissions to a dedicated test endpoint that logs but doesn't process data
- **FR-008**: System MUST use the same sample test data generated in the existing testing dashboard's "Generated Test Data:" block
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle forms with required fields appropriately
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide ability to delete/cleanup generated test forms
- **FR-011**: System MUST indicate which frameworks support form generation and which do not
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate forms using only basic field types (text, email, phone, textarea) regardless of framework capabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST restrict test form access to WordPress administrators only
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate unique identifiers for test forms to prevent conflicts
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve existing testing dashboard functionality while adding form builder capabilities
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent test form submissions from triggering real actions (emails, webhooks, database entries)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Form Template**: Represents a reusable form configuration including field types, labels, and validation rules
- **Test Data Set**: Collection of field values used to populate forms (e.g., name, email, phone, address)
- **Generated Form Instance**: The actual form created within a framework, tracked by unique ID and framework type
- **Framework Adapter**: Interface between the form builder and each specific form framework's creation mechanism
- **Test Session**: Context linking generated forms, test data, and captured tracking events
