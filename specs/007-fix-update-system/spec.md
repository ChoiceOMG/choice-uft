# Feature Specification: Fix Update System Inconsistencies

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-update-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix update system inconsistencies in wordpress admin. The Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin has multiple inconsistencies and UX issues in its update and notification system..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a WordPress administrator managing the Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin, I need consistent and accurate update notifications and a reliable update process so that I can keep my plugin current without confusion or errors. The update system should follow standard WordPress conventions for notice placement, status display, and security validation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin user is on the plugin settings page, **When** there is an update available, **Then** the admin notice appears above the page title in the standard WordPress notice area
2. **Given** an admin has successfully updated the plugin, **When** they view the admin bar, **Then** the "CUFT Update" indicator reflects the current version immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. **Given** an admin views the Updates tab, **When** checking version status, **Then** all displayed version information is consistent and accurate across all UI elements
4. **Given** an admin clicks the "Download & Install Update" button, **When** the request is processed, **Then** it completes successfully with proper security validation (no "Security check failed" error)
5. **Given** an update is available, **When** checking update status in different plugin interfaces, **Then** all indicators show the same update availability status consistently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple admin users are updating simultaneously?
- How does system handle partial update failures or network interruptions?
- What happens when version check returns invalid or malformed data?
- How does system behave when WordPress core update system conflicts with GitHub auto-update?
- What happens when user has insufficient permissions for updates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display admin notices above the page title following WordPress standard placement conventions
- **FR-002**: System MUST refresh the admin bar update indicator immediately after successful plugin updates without requiring manual page refresh
- **FR-003**: System MUST display consistent version information across all plugin interfaces (Settings page, Updates tab, Admin bar)
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform secure nonce-validated requests for all update operations including GitHub auto-updates
- **FR-005**: System MUST synchronize update detection across both manual and automatic checking mechanisms
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle update conflicts gracefully when both WordPress repository and GitHub updates are available
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when update operations fail, distinguishing between permission, connectivity, and validation issues
- **FR-008**: Update status checks MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum acceptable response time not specified - 3 seconds, 5 seconds?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain update history for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - last 5 updates, 30 days?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle concurrent update attempts by multiple administrators [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior not specified - queue, reject, or merge?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Update Status**: Current plugin version, available version, last check timestamp, update source (GitHub/WordPress)
- **Admin Notice**: Notice content, type (info/warning/error/success), dismissible state, display location
- **Update Transaction**: Update initiation time, completion status, error messages if any, user who initiated
- **Version Information**: Current version number, available version number, changelog/release notes reference
