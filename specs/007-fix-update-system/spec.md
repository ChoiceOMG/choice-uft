# Feature Specification: Fix Update System Inconsistencies

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-update-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix update system inconsistencies in wordpress admin. The Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin has multiple inconsistencies and UX issues in its update and notification system..."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a WordPress administrator managing the Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin, I need consistent and accurate update notifications and a reliable update process so that I can keep my plugin current without confusion or errors. The update system should follow standard WordPress conventions for notice placement, status display, and security validation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an admin user is on the plugin settings page, **When** there is an update available, **Then** the admin notice appears above the page title in the standard WordPress notice area
2. **Given** an admin has successfully updated the plugin, **When** they view the admin bar, **Then** the "CUFT Update" indicator reflects the current version immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. **Given** an admin views the Updates tab, **When** checking version status, **Then** all displayed version information is consistent and accurate across all UI elements
4. **Given** an admin clicks the "Download & Install Update" button, **When** the request is processed, **Then** it completes successfully with proper security validation (no "Security check failed" error)
5. **Given** an update is available, **When** checking update status in different plugin interfaces, **Then** all indicators show the same update availability status consistently

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple admin users are updating simultaneously? ‚Üí System intelligently coordinates and merges update requests
- How does system handle partial update failures or network interruptions? ‚Üí System automatically rolls back to previous version
- What happens when version check returns invalid or malformed data? ‚Üí System logs error and continues with current version
- How does system behave when WordPress core update system conflicts with GitHub auto-update?
- What happens when user has insufficient permissions for updates?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display admin notices above the page title following WordPress standard placement conventions
- **FR-002**: System MUST refresh the admin bar update indicator immediately after successful plugin updates without requiring manual page refresh
- **FR-003**: System MUST display consistent version information across all plugin interfaces (Settings page, Updates tab, Admin bar)
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform secure nonce-validated requests for all update operations including GitHub auto-updates
- **FR-005**: System MUST synchronize update detection across both manual and automatic checking mechanisms
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle update conflicts gracefully when both WordPress repository and GitHub updates are available
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when update operations fail, distinguishing between permission, connectivity, and validation issues
- **FR-008**: Update status checks MUST complete within 5 seconds
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain update history for the last 5 updates only
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle concurrent update attempts by multiple administrators by intelligently coordinating and merging update requests

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Update Status**: Current plugin version, available version, last check timestamp, update source (GitHub/WordPress)
- **Admin Notice**: Notice content, type (info/warning/error/success), dismissible state, display location
- **Update Transaction**: Update initiation time, completion status, error messages if any, user who initiated
- **Version Information**: Current version number, available version number, changelog/release notes reference

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: What is the maximum acceptable response time for update status checks (FR-008)? ‚Üí A: 5 seconds (acceptable for background check)
- Q: How long should the system maintain update history (FR-009)? ‚Üí A: Last 5 updates only
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent update attempts by multiple administrators (FR-010)? ‚Üí A: Merge/coordinate updates intelligently
- Q: How should the system handle partial update failures or network interruptions? ‚Üí A: Rollback to previous version automatically
- Q: How should the system handle invalid or malformed version data from update checks? ‚Üí A: Log error and continue with current version

## Notes

**WARNING**: Specification has uncertainties that need clarification:

- None remaining (all critical ambiguities resolved)
