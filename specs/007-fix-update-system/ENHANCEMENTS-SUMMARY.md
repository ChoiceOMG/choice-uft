## Implemented Enhancements

### âœ… High Priority (Complete)

#### 1. Implementation Guide Document
**File**: `implementation-guide.md` (NEW - 600+ lines)

**Contents**:
- Quick reference index mapping research sections to tasks
- Detailed data model cross-references
- API contract locations for all endpoints
- Test scenario mappings
- Task-to-detail mapping for all 41 tasks
- File reference map (PHP, JavaScript, new files)
- Critical path with research references
- Common question answers
- Usage tips and quick lookups

**Impact**: Implementers can now quickly find all context needed for any task without searching through multiple documents.

#### 2. File Reference Map in tasks.md
**Location**: tasks.md lines 19-54

**Added**:
- Table of PHP files to modify with line numbers and research references
- Table of JavaScript files with current issues
- Table of new files to create with purposes
- Quick reference link to implementation-guide.md

**Impact**: Developers immediately see all files they'll work on and where to find related documentation.

#### 3. Cross-References to Critical Path Tasks
**Enhanced Tasks**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T009, T010, T017, T018

**Added to Each**:

#### 6. Line Number References
**Added to**: File reference map and task descriptions

**Line Numbers Added**:
- `class-cuft-admin-notices.php`: Line 42-44 (exclusions to remove)
- `class-cuft-updater-ajax.php`: Line 25 (NONCE_ACTION), lines 66-78 (verify_request)
- `class-cuft-wordpress-updater.php`: Lines 85-91 (check_for_updates)
- Research document: Specific line ranges for all key sections
- Contracts: Line ranges for all endpoint specifications
- Quickstart: Line ranges for all test scenarios

**Impact**: Developers can jump directly to relevant code sections without searching.

#### 7. Data Model Validation Task (T008a)
**File**: tasks.md lines 339-392 (NEW)

**Added Task**: T008a - Validate All Data Models
- Comprehensive unit tests for all 4 data models
- FIFO cleanup validation
- Context-aware timeout testing
- User tracking validation
- Site transient behavior verification
- **Gate before AJAX implementation**

**Impact**: Ensures all data models are working correctly before building AJAX layer on top, preventing integration issues later.
