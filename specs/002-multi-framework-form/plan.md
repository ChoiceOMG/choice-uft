## Summary
The Choice Universal Form Tracker already tracks form submissions across 5 WordPress form frameworks (Elementor Pro, Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms, and Avada Forms) but requires improvements to achieve full constitutional compliance and enhanced reliability. The implementation needs to strengthen framework detection, improve error handling, optimize performance, and ensure complete standardization of dataLayer events.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES5-compatible for WordPress compatibility)
**Primary Dependencies**: WordPress 5.0+, PHP 7.0+, Google Tag Manager
**Storage**: WordPress options API, SessionStorage, Cookies (fallback chain)
**Testing**: Manual testing with test forms, automated dataLayer validation
**Target Platform**: WordPress websites (all modern browsers)
**Project Type**: WordPress plugin (existing architecture)
**Performance Goals**: <50ms total processing per form submission
**Constraints**: Must work without jQuery, no console noise for non-matching forms
**Scale/Scope**: 5 form frameworks, 37 functional requirements, ~5000 LOC existing
**User Input**: "we have a solution in place, but it needs improvement"

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### 1. JavaScript-First Compatibility ✅ (75% → 100% target)
- **Current**: Gravity Forms already compliant, others need verification
- **Improvement**: Ensure ALL frameworks use native JS as primary, jQuery as fallback
- **Justification**: Phase 1 already addressed framework detection issues

### 2. DataLayer Standardization ✅ (100% compliant)
- **Current**: Already using snake_case, cuft_tracked, cuft_source
- **Improvement**: Maintain compliance in new code
- **Justification**: Core requirement already met

### 3. Framework Compatibility ⚠️ (75% → 100% target)
- **Current**: Silent exit implemented in Phase 1
- **Improvement**: Add comprehensive error boundaries
- **Justification**: Phase 1 fixed logging before detection

### 4. Event Firing Rules ✅ (100% compliant)
- **Current**: generate_lead logic correctly requires email+phone+click_id
- **Improvement**: Maintain current implementation
- **Justification**: Already meets constitutional requirements

### 5. Error Handling Philosophy ⚠️ (60% → 100% target)
- **Current**: Some try-catch blocks, needs comprehensive coverage
- **Improvement**: Add error isolation to all external calls
- **Justification**: Critical for production reliability

### 6. Performance Optimization ⚠️ (40% → 100% target)
- **Current**: Document-wide MutationObservers, no cleanup
- **Improvement**: Scope observers, implement cleanup, optimize queries
- **Justification**: Required for scale and user experience

**Structure Decision**: Maintain existing WordPress plugin structure with incremental improvements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Completed:
1. **Existing Implementation Analysis**:
   - Decision: Incremental improvement approach
   - Rationale: Working solution exists, minimize disruption
   - Alternatives considered: Complete rewrite (rejected - too risky)

2. **Constitutional Compliance Gaps**:
   - Decision: Prioritize error handling and performance
   - Rationale: These have lowest compliance (60% and 40%)
   - Alternatives considered: Feature additions (deferred)

3. **Framework-Specific Issues**:
   - Decision: Maintain individual framework files
   - Rationale: Cleaner separation, easier maintenance
   - Alternatives considered: Single consolidated file (too complex)

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Decision: Enhance test infrastructure with automated validation
   - Rationale: Manual testing insufficient for 5 frameworks
   - Alternatives considered: Unit tests (difficult in WordPress context)

**Output**: See [research.md](./research.md) for detailed findings

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 1. Data Model ([data-model.md](./data-model.md))
**Core Entities**:
- FormSubmission (standardized across all frameworks)
- TrackingParameters (UTM + click IDs)
- FrameworkConfig (per-framework settings)
- FeatureFlags (migration control)

### 2. Event Contracts ([contracts/](./contracts/))
**Standardized Events**:
- `form_submit`: Universal submission event
- `generate_lead`: Conversion event with strict criteria

### 3. Testing Infrastructure ([quickstart.md](./quickstart.md))
**Test Scenarios**:
- Framework detection accuracy
- Field extraction reliability
- Multi-step form handling
- Cross-framework interference
- Performance benchmarks

### 4. Agent Context Update
- Execute: `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
- Updates CLAUDE.md with improved tracking requirements

## Phase 2: Task Generation Strategy (for /tasks command)

### Task Categories:
1. **Critical Fixes** (P0):
   - Comprehensive error handling implementation
   - Memory leak prevention (observer cleanup)

2. **Performance Improvements** (P1):
   - MutationObserver scoping
   - Event listener optimization
   - DOM query caching

3. **Reliability Enhancements** (P2):
   - Retry logic standardization
   - Timeout management
   - State cleanup

4. **Testing & Validation** (P3):
   - Automated test suite
   - Performance monitoring
   - Cross-browser validation

### Task Dependencies:
```
Critical Fixes → Performance Improvements → Reliability → Testing
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓          ↓
Error Handling    Observer Scoping      Retry Logic   Test Suite
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓          ↓
Try-Catch         Query Caching        Timeouts      Monitoring
```

## Progress Tracking

### Completed:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check (violations documented)
- [x] Phase 0: Research (gaps identified)
- [x] Phase 1: Design (contracts created)
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check (improvements validated)
- [x] Phase 2: Planning (task strategy defined)

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Run `/tasks` command to generate implementation tasks
- [ ] Execute tasks in priority order
- [ ] Validate improvements against constitution
- [ ] Deploy with feature flags for gradual rollout

## Complexity Tracking

### Constitution Violations Addressed:
1. **Error Handling (60% → Target 100%)**
   - Justification: Critical for production stability
   - Approach: Comprehensive try-catch, error boundaries

2. **Performance (40% → Target 100%)**
   - Justification: Required for user experience
   - Approach: Observer scoping, memory management

3. **Framework Compatibility (75% → Target 100%)**
   - Justification: Already improved in Phase 1
   - Approach: Complete error isolation

### Risk Mitigation:
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout
- Existing implementation remains functional
- Incremental improvements reduce regression risk
- Comprehensive testing before full deployment

**Status**: Plan complete, ready for `/tasks` command to generate implementation tasks.
