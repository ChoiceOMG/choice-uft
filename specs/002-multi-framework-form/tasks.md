# Tasks: Multi-framework Form Submission Tracking Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-multi-framework-form/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → SUCCESS: WordPress plugin, JavaScript ES5, 5 frameworks
   → Extract: Incremental improvements for constitutional compliance
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 5 entities identified → model/utility tasks
   → contracts/: 2 files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Performance gaps, error handling needs
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: error boundaries, performance monitoring
   → Tests: contract validation, framework testing
   → Core: error handling, observer cleanup, retry logic
   → Integration: feature flags, monitoring
   → Polish: performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph based on constitutional gaps
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. SUCCESS: 30 tasks covering all improvement areas
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

WordPress plugin structure (existing):

- `assets/forms/` - Framework-specific JavaScript files
- `assets/` - Shared JavaScript utilities
- `includes/` - PHP classes
- `test/standalone/test-no-jquery.html` - Test page (from Phase 1)

## Dependencies

### Setup Dependencies

- T001 (error boundary) before T015-T019
- T002 (performance monitor) before T020-T025
- T003 (observer cleanup) before T020-T023, T028
- T004 (retry logic) before T029

### Test-First Dependencies

- T005-T006 (contract tests) before any implementation
- T007-T011 (error tests) before T015-T019
- T012-T014 (performance tests) before T020-T025

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before task execution_

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T006)
- [x] All 5 frameworks have error handling tasks (T015-T019)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T014 before T015+)
- [x] Parallel tasks modify different files or are truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitutional gaps addressed: Error Handling (60%→100%), Performance (40%→100%), Framework Compatibility (75%→100%)

## Success Criteria

### Constitutional Compliance Targets

1. **Error Handling**: 100% compliance with comprehensive try-catch coverage
2. **Performance**: <30ms processing time, proper observer cleanup
3. **Framework Compatibility**: Complete error isolation between frameworks
4. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks, all observers cleaned up
5. **Reliability**: Retry logic, timeout management, graceful degradation

### Technical Metrics

- Form processing time: <30ms (improvement from ~48ms)
- Memory usage: <1KB per form (improvement from ~2KB)
- Error rate: <0.1% of form submissions
- Observer cleanup: 100% within timeout periods
- Cross-framework interference: 0 instances

### Functional Validation

- All 5 frameworks track successfully with error boundaries
- Performance tests pass on all modern browsers
- Memory leak tests show no persistent observers
- Contract validation passes for both event types
- Constitutional compliance reaches 100% across all principles

## Notes

- **Priority**: Focus on P0 (Critical Fixes) before P1 (Performance)
- **Rollback**: Feature flags enable instant rollback if issues detected
- **Testing**: Each improvement must pass corresponding test before deployment
- **Documentation**: Update quickstart guide with new debug capabilities
- **Validation**: Use existing Phase 1 test infrastructure for verification
