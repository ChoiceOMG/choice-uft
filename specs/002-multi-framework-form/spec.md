- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website owner using various WordPress form plugins (Elementor Pro, Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms, or Avada/Fusion), I want all form submissions to be automatically tracked and sent to Google Tag Manager so that I can monitor conversions and user interactions in Google Analytics 4, regardless of which form framework is used on any given page.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Universal Requirements (All Frameworks)
1. **Given** any supported form on a webpage, **When** a user successfully submits the form, **Then** a `form_submit` event is pushed to the dataLayer with standardized field names
2. **Given** a form with email and phone fields, **When** submitted with valid data, **Then** user_email and user_phone are captured and included in the tracking event
3. **Given** a user arriving with UTM parameters or click IDs, **When** they submit any form, **Then** all tracking parameters are preserved and included in the event
4. **Given** a form with email, phone, and click ID present, **When** submitted successfully, **Then** both `form_submit` and `generate_lead` events are fired

#### Framework-Specific Scenarios

**Elementor Pro Forms**:
1. **Given** an Elementor form with multi-step configuration, **When** the user completes all steps and submits, **Then** tracking fires only on final step completion
2. **Given** an Elementor form in a popup, **When** submitted successfully and popup closes, **Then** the submission is still tracked
3. **Given** an Elementor form with invalid regex patterns, **When** the page loads, **Then** patterns are automatically fixed to prevent browser errors

**Contact Form 7**:
1. **Given** a CF7 form, **When** the `wpcf7mailsent` event fires, **Then** form submission is tracked
2. **Given** multiple CF7 forms on the same page, **When** any form is submitted, **Then** only that specific form's data is tracked
3. **Given** a CF7 form with custom field names, **When** submitted, **Then** email and phone are still detected correctly

**Ninja Forms**:
1. **Given** a Ninja Form with AJAX submission, **When** success message appears, **Then** form submission is tracked
2. **Given** a multi-step Ninja Form, **When** final step is submitted, **Then** tracking occurs only once
3. **Given** a Ninja Form that hides after submission, **When** form disappears, **Then** submission is detected and tracked

**Gravity Forms**:
1. **Given** a Gravity Form with complex fields (multi-part phone/name), **When** submitted, **Then** field values are correctly extracted and combined
2. **Given** a multi-page Gravity Form, **When** final page is submitted, **Then** tracking fires only on completion
3. **Given** a Gravity Form with conditional logic, **When** submitted with hidden fields, **Then** only visible field values are captured

**Avada/Fusion Forms**:
1. **Given** a dynamically loaded Fusion Form, **When** added to page via builder, **Then** form is automatically detected for tracking
2. **Given** an Avada form with multi-step flow, **When** final step completes, **Then** submission is tracked once
3. **Given** a Fusion form in a modal, **When** submitted and modal closes, **Then** tracking still occurs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple different frameworks exist on the same page?
  ‚Üí Each framework's forms are tracked independently without interference
- How does system handle forms without email/phone fields?
  ‚Üí Forms are tracked with available data; missing fields are omitted
- What happens when form submission fails on the server side?
  ‚Üí Only successful submissions (confirmed by framework) are tracked
- How does system handle rapid multiple submissions?
  ‚Üí Deduplication prevents the same submission from being tracked twice
- What happens when JavaScript errors occur in other scripts?
  ‚Üí Error isolation ensures tracking continues to function
- How are forms in iframes handled?
  ‚Üí Forms in same-origin iframes are tracked; cross-origin iframes are not accessible

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Framework Detection & Compatibility
