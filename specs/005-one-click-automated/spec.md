# Feature Specification: One-Click Automated Update

**Feature Branch**: `005-one-click-automated`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "one click automated update feature that uses the latest version published on github."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: administrators (actors), one-click update (action), GitHub releases (data source), version updates (constraint)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: When an update fails mid-process, should the system automatically attempt to restore the previous plugin version? ‚Üí A: Always rollback - Automatically restore previous version on any failure
- Q: How often should the system check for new plugin updates from GitHub? ‚Üí A: Twice daily
- Q: Which repository should the plugin use for downloading updates? ‚Üí A: Public repo - ChoiceOMG/choice-uft
- Q: Where should update availability notifications be displayed to administrators? ‚Üí A: WordPress updates page - Integrate with WordPress's standard Updates menu
- Q: Which WordPress capability should be required for users to perform plugin updates? ‚Üí A: update_plugins - Standard WordPress capability for updating plugins

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a WordPress administrator, I want to update the Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin to the latest version with a single click, so I can keep the plugin current with bug fixes and new features without manually downloading and installing files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new version is available on GitHub releases, **When** the administrator clicks the update button, **Then** the plugin updates to the latest version and displays a success message
2. **Given** the current version is already the latest, **When** the administrator checks for updates, **Then** the system displays "Already up to date" message
3. **Given** an update is in progress, **When** the administrator attempts another update, **Then** the system prevents concurrent updates and shows "Update already in progress"
4. **Given** an update fails due to network issues, **When** the administrator views the status, **Then** the system displays a clear error message with retry option

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub releases are unavailable due to network issues?
- How does system handle corrupted downloads or partial updates?
- What happens if WordPress lacks write permissions to the plugin directory?
- How does the system handle rollback if an update fails midway? (Clarified: automatic rollback on any failure)
- What happens when multiple administrators attempt updates simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when a new version is available by comparing current plugin version with latest GitHub release
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a one-click update action for administrators
- **FR-003**: System MUST download the plugin package from the public GitHub repository ChoiceOMG/choice-uft
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify the integrity of downloaded updates before installation
- **FR-005**: Administrators MUST be able to see current version and available version information
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent concurrent update attempts while an update is in progress
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear status feedback during the update process (checking, downloading, installing, complete)
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should there be automatic backup before update?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle update failures gracefully with automatic rollback to the previous version on any failure
- **FR-010**: Update notifications MUST appear in the WordPress Updates page integrated with standard WordPress plugin updates
- **FR-011**: System MUST check for updates twice daily (every 12 hours) and allow manual checks on-demand
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect WordPress capability requirements for update_plugins permission
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve plugin settings and data during updates
- **FR-014**: System MUST log update activities for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: audit trail requirements - what details, retention period?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: beta/pre-release versions or stable releases only?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Plugin Version**: Current installed version information including version number, release date, and changelog
- **GitHub Release**: Available update information including version number, release notes, download URL, and publication date
- **Update Status**: Current state of update process including progress indicators and result messages
- **Update Log**: Historical record of update attempts, successes, and failures with timestamps
