## Next Steps After Verification

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Layout has extra whitespace where progress bar was
**Solution**: Check that method call was removed from line 114 in class-cuft-admin.php

**Issue**: Update progress doesn't display
**Solution**: Verify no changes were made to class-cuft-admin-notices.php or cuft-progress-indicator.js

**Issue**: CSS errors in console
**Solution**: Ensure only lines 37-84 were removed from cuft-admin.css, not update progress styles

**Issue**: Settings page looks broken
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and WordPress object cache, hard refresh page
