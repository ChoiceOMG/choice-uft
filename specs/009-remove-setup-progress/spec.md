## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a WordPress administrator managing the Choice Universal Form Tracker plugin, I want the setup progress indicator removed from the admin interface so that the admin page has a cleaner, more streamlined appearance without tracking setup completion status.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a WordPress admin visits the plugin settings page, **When** they view the admin interface, **Then** they should NOT see a setup progress indicator displaying completion status for GTM configuration and framework detection.

2. **Given** the plugin is partially configured (e.g., GTM ID not set), **When** an admin accesses the settings, **Then** no progress bar or setup steps indicator should be displayed.

3. **Given** the plugin is fully configured, **When** an admin accesses the settings, **Then** no progress completion indicator should be displayed.

4. **Given** a plugin update is in progress, **When** an admin views the WordPress admin area, **Then** update progress notifications should still function normally (unaffected by this change).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when administrators who were previously using the setup progress as a guide try to configure the plugin after removal?
  - Plugin configuration should still be fully functional through the standard settings form interface
  - All configuration options remain accessible through their respective input fields

- How does the system differentiate between setup progress and update progress?
  - Setup progress tracks configuration completion (GTM setup, framework detection, testing)
  - Update progress tracks plugin version updates and installations
  - Only setup progress components should be removed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST NOT display a setup progress indicator in the plugin admin interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT render setup completion percentage calculations
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT show visual progress steps for GTM configuration, framework detection, or testing completion
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing plugin configuration functionality without the progress indicator
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain update progress indicators and notifications (distinct from setup progress)
- **FR-006**: Admin interface MUST remain fully functional for users to configure GTM ID, enable/disable features, and manage settings
- **FR-007**: System MUST NOT store or calculate setup completion status after removal

### Key Entities

- **Setup Progress Indicator**: Visual component showing plugin configuration completion status with progress bar and step indicators
  - Displays completion percentage
  - Shows status of: GTM Configuration, Framework Detection, Testing Complete
  - Rendered conditionally based on setup completion

- **Setup Step Status**: Configuration state tracking setup completion
  - GTM Setup: Whether GTM ID is configured
  - Framework Detected: Whether at least one form framework is detected
  - Testing Complete: Whether testing has been completed

- **Update Progress Components**: Plugin version update status indicators (NOT affected by this feature)
  - Update availability notices
  - Update installation progress
  - Update completion/failure notifications
