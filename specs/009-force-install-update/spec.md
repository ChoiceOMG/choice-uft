## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable duration for a "Check for Updates" operation before timeout? ‚Üí A: 5 seconds - Fast feedback, may fail on slow networks
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable duration for a force reinstall operation before timeout? ‚Üí A: 60 seconds - Standard timeout for typical plugin sizes
- Q: What is the minimum free disk space required before allowing a force reinstall operation? ‚Üí A: 3x plugin size - Very safe, allows backup + download + extraction buffer
- Q: Should the "Check for Updates" button also clear WordPress's internal plugin update cache, or only query GitHub? ‚Üí A: Clear cache + query GitHub - Forces WordPress to recognize new version immediately
- Q: Which update-related capabilities are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this feature? ‚Üí A: Both automatic scheduled updates and downgrade to older versions - Manual-only, latest-version-only feature
- Q: How long should update history entries be retained before automatic cleanup? ‚Üí A: 7 days - Minimal retention, recent activity only
- Q: Should the system emit metrics/events for monitoring tools when update operations fail or succeed? ‚Üí A: No - Logging to update history is sufficient, no additional monitoring integration needed
- Q: What is the maximum expected concurrency scenario for update operations? ‚Üí A: Single-site only - One WordPress installation, multiple admins may access simultaneously

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a WordPress administrator, I need the ability to manually check if a new plugin version is available from GitHub, bypassing WordPress's automatic update schedule. When automatic updates fail or when I need to immediately install the latest version, I need a "force reinstall" option that downloads and installs the current latest release even if WordPress thinks the plugin is already up-to-date.

### Explicit Out-of-Scope
The following capabilities are explicitly **NOT** included in this feature:
- **Automatic scheduled updates**: This feature provides only manual, on-demand update checking and installation. Automatic background updates remain handled by existing WordPress mechanisms.
- **Downgrade to older versions**: Only the latest available version can be installed. Version selection, rollback to previous versions, or installation of specific version numbers are not supported.
- **External monitoring integration**: This feature logs operations to the update history only. It does not emit metrics or events for external monitoring tools, alerting systems, or observability platforms.
- **Multi-site network support**: This feature is designed for single-site WordPress installations only. Multi-site network environments, subsite-specific update controls, and network-wide update management are not supported.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Manual Update Check
1. **Given** the plugin is installed and active, **When** the administrator clicks "Check for Updates" in the plugin settings, **Then** the system clears WordPress plugin cache, queries GitHub for the latest release, and displays whether a new version is available
2. **Given** a new version exists on GitHub, **When** the check completes, **Then** the system displays the new version number, release date, and an "Update Now" button, and WordPress immediately recognizes the new version across all admin interfaces
3. **Given** the plugin is already at the latest version, **When** the check completes, **Then** the system displays "Plugin is up to date" with the current version number

#### Scenario 2: Force Reinstall
1. **Given** an automatic update failed (corrupted download, incomplete installation, etc.), **When** the administrator clicks "Force Reinstall Latest Version", **Then** the system downloads and installs the latest release from GitHub regardless of current installed version
2. **Given** the force reinstall succeeds, **When** the installation completes, **Then** the system displays a success message with the reinstalled version number and the plugin remains active
3. **Given** the force reinstall fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the system displays the error message, preserves the previous working version (if backup exists), and provides instructions for manual installation

#### Scenario 3: Update Check Status Feedback
1. **Given** the administrator triggers an update check, **When** the check is in progress, **Then** the system displays a loading indicator and disables the check button to prevent duplicate requests
2. **Given** the GitHub API is unavailable, **When** the check times out after 5 seconds, **Then** the system displays "Unable to check for updates. Please try again later" and logs the error
3. **Given** multiple administrators, **When** one triggers an update check, **Then** other administrators see the updated version information without needing to refresh

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub rate limits the API request? System should cache the result and display last known version information with a timestamp
- How does the system handle a force reinstall when disk space is insufficient? System should check that at least 3x plugin size is available before attempting download, and display clear error message with exact space requirements if insufficient
- What happens if the plugin is deactivated during force reinstall? System should abort the reinstall and display warning message
- How does the system handle concurrent update attempts by multiple administrators on a single-site installation? System should use locking mechanism to allow only one update operation at a time
- What happens when the force reinstall downloads a corrupted ZIP file? System should validate file integrity before extraction and restore from backup if validation fails
- What happens when force reinstall exceeds 60 seconds? System should timeout, display error message with manual installation instructions, and preserve existing plugin functionality

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Manual Update Check (FR-101-104)
- **FR-101**: System MUST provide a "Check for Updates" button in the plugin settings page that clears WordPress plugin update cache and queries GitHub for the latest release when clicked

#### Security & Safety (FR-401-404)
- **FR-401**: System MUST verify administrator capabilities (update_plugins) before allowing update check or force reinstall actions
- **FR-402**: System MUST prevent concurrent update/reinstall operations using transient-based locking for single-site installations where multiple administrators may access simultaneously
- **FR-403**: System MUST respect the DISALLOW_FILE_MODS constant and disable force reinstall when file modifications are disabled
- **FR-404**: System MUST validate GitHub download URLs to ensure they originate from the official repository

#### Error Handling & Recovery (FR-501-503)
- **FR-501**: System MUST handle GitHub API rate limiting by caching results and displaying last known information
- **FR-502**: System MUST check available disk space before force reinstall, requiring minimum 3x current plugin size (for backup + download + extraction), and display clear disk space requirements if insufficient
- **FR-503**: System MUST preserve plugin functionality when operations fail (no broken installations)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance (NFR-101-103)
- **NFR-101**: Update check operations MUST complete or timeout within 5 seconds maximum
- **NFR-102**: System MUST display timeout error message when GitHub API does not respond within 5 seconds
- **NFR-103**: Force reinstall operations MUST complete or timeout within 60 seconds maximum, displaying clear timeout error with manual installation instructions

#### Resource Requirements (NFR-201)
- **NFR-201**: Force reinstall operations MUST require minimum 3x current plugin size in available disk space before proceeding (accommodates backup + download + extraction)

#### Scalability (NFR-301)
- **NFR-301**: System is designed for single-site WordPress installations supporting concurrent access by multiple administrators, not multi-site network environments
